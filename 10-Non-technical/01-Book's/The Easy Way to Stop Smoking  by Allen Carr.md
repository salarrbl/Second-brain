## Part 1: Why Do We Smoke?

- **The illusion of pleasure**: Smoking doesn’t bring real pleasure; it merely relieves the craving caused by nicotine addiction.

    1. Smoking temporarily satisfies the need for nicotine.
    2. The body quickly craves nicotine again.
    3. The smoker lights up another cigarette, repeating the cycle.
